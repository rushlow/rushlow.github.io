I am an Assistant Professor of Economics at Illinois Wesleyan University. 

My research focuses on environmental and natural resource economics, with an emphasis on spatial resource decision-making. I often use simulation analysis to examine these questions in a developing country context. My past and current work includes studying transportation intermediaries and their role in spatial resource harvesting decisions in rural markets, estimating wild meat market substitution elasticities to evaluate policy implications, analyzing the relationship between international wildlife trade and development, and evaluating labor tradeoffs in ecosystem service valuation in low-income communities. 

My teaching includes courses in environmental and natural resource economics, development economics, and intermediate microeconomics. I am also involved with undergraduate student research and enjoy mentoring students as they develop their own research questions, projects, and papers.
